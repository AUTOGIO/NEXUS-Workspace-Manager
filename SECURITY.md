## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### **Data Privacy**
NEXUS is designed with privacy in mind:
- No data is sent to external servers without explicit user consent
- All AI processing happens locally on your machine
- Configuration files are stored locally
- Logs can be configured to exclude sensitive information

### **System Access**
NEXUS requires certain system permissions for functionality:
- **Accessibility Access**: For window management automation
- **Screen Recording**: For workspace analysis (optional)
- **Input Monitoring**: For keyboard shortcuts and gestures (optional)

### **AI Model Security**
- Models are loaded and executed locally
- No data is sent to external AI services by default
- Users can choose which models to enable
- Model files are validated before loading

## üîß Security Best Practices

### **For Users**
1. **Keep NEXUS Updated**: Regularly update to the latest version
2. **Review Permissions**: Only grant necessary system permissions
3. **Secure Configuration**: Protect your configuration files
4. **Monitor Logs**: Regularly check logs for suspicious activity
5. **Use Strong Models**: Choose well-vetted AI models

### **For Contributors**
1. **Code Reviews**: All changes undergo security review
2. **Dependency Scanning**: Dependencies are scanned for vulnerabilities
3. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
4. **Error Handling**: Errors don't leak sensitive information
5. **Testing**: Security tests are included in our test suite

## üö® Known Security Considerations

### **System Integration Risks**
- NEXUS integrates deeply with macOS window management
- Requires accessibility permissions for automation
- Can control window positioning and application launching

### **AI Model Risks**
- Large language models may have biases or generate inappropriate content
- Model outputs should be reviewed before acting on recommendations
- Some models may require significant system resources

### **Configuration Risks**
- Configuration files may contain sensitive information
- Profile settings affect system behavior
- Third-party integrations inherit their security properties
